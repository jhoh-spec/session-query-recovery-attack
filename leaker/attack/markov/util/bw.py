# function baum_welch_from_file is a wrapper function that allows the user to run the Baum Welch algorithm on
# a sequence stored in a .txt file and not passed directly as a list. It first reads the sequence
# from the file and formats it so that baum_welch can be called on the sequence.
# NOTE: this function is not used in the experiment, but can be helpful for running the Baum Welch
# algorithm on the same sequence to see how different parameters affect the algorithm

# function baum_welch runs the Baum Welch algorithm on a passed sequence or list of sequences
# the user can choose to provide an emissions probability matrix (probability that observation i
# will be seen from state j), a transition probability matrix (probability that state i will follow
# state j), or a start probability matrix (probability that the markov chain will begin at state i) that
# will seed the Baum Welch algorithm. If these parameters are not provided, random matrices will be created
# Parameters:
#   samples_list: a list of sequences (ex: a list of observed leakage sequences)
#   dir_name: a path to a directory where the results of the Baum Welch algorithm will be written
#   em_path: path to a file containing the emissions probability matrix. Must be written in a form that can
#           automatically interpreted as a np.matrix (ie 1 0; .5 .5)
#   start_path: path to a file containing the start probability matrix. Must be written in a form that can
#           automatically interpreted as a np.matrix (ie 0 0 1 0)
#   trans_path: path to a file containing the transition probability matrix. Must be written in a form that can
#           automatically interpreted as a np.matrix (ie 1 0; .5 .5)
#   em_identity: boolean value to determine if an identity matrix should be used for the emissions' matrix. If True and
#                an em_path is provided, the em_path will not be used and the identity matrix will be used instead
#   num_states: the value of num_states will be used to determine the number of states the hmm will be initialized with
#               if non-positive, the number of unique observations in samples_list will be used
